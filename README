midnitelogger v0.4

I wrote this program to help me log data from multiple Midnite
Classic charge controllers over their ethernet connections
using the built in modbus TCP port.

Some notes:
I've only tested this on the Classic 200.  I've not tried any
other variations (because I don't own them), including the "Lite"
versions.

I've tested this with 17 Classics @ 5 second polling intervals.

The software tries to be smart about connectivity and ignores
Classics that it can't communicate with while continuing to
poll data from the others.

I chose postgres for databasing because it seems to work well
with huge numeric data sets such as this which would permit
a reasonable machine to log at ~5 second intervals for years
without much effort.

A schema output from my database is included.

This program does not write to any registers.  It only reads a
couple small blocks of them to get all of the data that is
meaningful for logging.

Hopefully someone else finds this useful.

I am not affiliated with Midnite Solar.

I've only tested and compiled this on Debian Wheezy x64, but I
don't see why it wouldn't work elsewhere.

Pull requests welcome. (Please use tabs for indentation!)

It's not my prettiest code, and likely has bugs, but it seems
to work for me in testing.

midnitelogger v0.4 - (C) 2015 Jason Hughes (wk_fs@skie.net)
Usage: ./midnitelogger [-dboL] [--dbname=DB_NAME] [--dbuser=X] [--dbpass=X|--dbpassfile=X] [--dbhost=X] [--C=host [--C=host]...]

   -d               debugging output (silent otherwise)
   -b               fork into background after successful launch
   -o               output read data to console (default is csv output)
   -T               print csv header as first output line (for use with -o)
   -H               human readable local output (for use with -o, not compatible with -H)
   -N               do not load charge controller list from database (requires -C)
   -R               do not write data to database
   -L               local usage only, no database. (same as -R -L)
                     requires at least one ip/port argument (-C)
                     goes well with -o.  db* arguments ignored
   -C host          IP or hostname of Midnite Classic (for use with -L), can do multiple
   -i seconds       polling interval in seconds (default: 5)
   -O               one shot (exit after first data output)
   -P port          port to use for modbus TCP connection (default: 502)
                     ^ Applies to all connections (local or DB fetched)
   -F               temperatures in fahrenheit (only works with -H, db always in C)
   --dbname=X       postgres database name (-n)
   --dbuser=X       postgres username (-u)
   --dbhost=X       postgres database host/ip (default: localhost) (-h)
   --dbpass=X       postgres password for dbuser (-p)
   --dbpassfile=X   file containing password for dbuser (-f)

The program will attempt to connect to all hosts specified on the command
line or in the database.  If not using -O it will periodially attempt to
reconnect to specified hosts it doesn't have a working connection to.

The program ignores valid hostnames/ips that it can not connect to.

Sample charge_controler_list insert:

   insert into charge_controller_list (name, smallname, ip, mac, serial, deviceid) VALUES ('Midnite Classic 200 A', 'Roof', '192.168.1.101', '60:1D:0F:00:00:00', 12345, 'FFFF FFFF');

Currently most of the fields are not used by this software (and are retrievable using the IP) so, only for some future front end usage.
